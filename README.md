# Personal portfolio 
This project is a simple personal portfolio designed to showcase the projects I’ve completed. It serves as a way to demonstrate my skills when applying for jobs or for other professional opportunities. The entire portfolio is built using Next.js.

# Project structure 
The portfolio is personalized and includes both customized content and design. It features the following:

- A homepage with a photo and a brief introduction highlighting my skills.
- A header that allows easy navigation between the different sections of the portfolio.
- A footer with links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and other profiles.
- Project pages describing past work, including detailed descriptions and a list of technologies used.
